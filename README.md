# IBM-Machine-Learning-Capstone
This is the capstone project from IBM Machine Learning Specialization Certificate

A recommender system is a machine learning tool that uses data to help users find content and products. They are a common feature on websites and streaming services, where they create pages and content that say "for you" or "you might also like". Recommender systems can help users who are overwhelmed by choice, which can lead to happier customers and more sales.

In this capstone, we will build course recommend system to our users by recommend the courses that are similar related to their preferences or their neighbor's preferences on their enrolled courses.
